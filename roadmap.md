Of course! This is an excellent project that combines web development, real-time communication, and third-party integrations. Here is a comprehensive roadmap for your Restaurant Reservations Manager, complete with detailed user stories in your specified format.

### Project Overview: Restaurant Reservations Manager

This system will provide restaurant staff with a real-time dashboard to manage table reservations. Clients can book tables through a simple interface, and admins will be notified via Telegram to confirm or decline these requests instantly. The system will also proactively send reminders to clients to reduce no-shows.

### High-Level Roadmap

The project is broken down into four logical phases, building from a foundational core to advanced features and deployment.

*   **Phase 1: Foundation & Core MVP**
    *   Goal: Establish the project structure, database, and essential features for an admin to manage tables and a client to make a basic reservation.
    *   Key Outcomes: A functional, albeit manual, reservation system.

*   **Phase 2: Real-time Admin Workflow & Telegram Integration**
    *   Goal: Implement the primary "special feature" of Telegram notifications and actions. Introduce real-time updates to the frontend.
    *   Key Outcomes: Admins can manage reservations from their phones, and the dashboard updates instantly.

*   **Phase 3: Client Experience & Automation**
    *   Goal: Enhance the client-side of the application by adding automated reminders and user profile management.
    *   Key Outcomes: Reduced no-shows and improved customer satisfaction.

*   **Phase 4: Polish, Analytics & Deployment**
    *   Goal: Prepare the application for production use by adding analytics, ensuring security, and setting up a deployment pipeline.
    *   Key Outcomes: A production-ready, secure, and maintainable application.

### Detailed User Stories by Phase

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Core MVP**

This phase focuses on building the skeleton of the application.

#### **User Story 1.1: Admin Table Management**
**As a** Restaurant Admin,
**I need to** create, view, update, and delete tables in the system, specifying their capacity and location (e.g., "Patio Table 5"),
**so that** I can accurately represent my restaurant's floor plan for reservations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can access a `/tables` section in the dashboard.
- A form allows creating a table with a name/number and a guest capacity.
- The list of tables is displayed in a grid or list.
- Each table has an edit and delete button.
- All tables are created with a default `status` of 'available' (green).

**Tech Stack:** Next.js (Frontend Form/UI), FastAPI (CRUD endpoints for `/tables`), Pydantic (Table schema validation), PostgreSQL/SQLite (Database), SQLAlchemy (ORM).

**Context:** This is the foundational data model. Without tables, no reservations can be made. It's the first step in setting up the restaurant's digital twin.

#### **User Story 1.2: Client Reservation Request**
**As a** Restaurant Client,
**I need to** select a date, time, and party size to see available tables and submit a reservation request,
**so that** I can book a table for my visit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The client-facing page shows a form for date, time, and party size.
- Upon form submission, the backend calculates table availability.
- If a table is available, a reservation is created in the database with a `status` of "pending".
- The client receives a confirmation message on the screen stating their request is pending approval.
- The corresponding table on the admin dashboard turns yellow.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js (React Server Components for initial load, Client Components for form interactivity), FastAPI (endpoint for availability check and reservation creation), Pydantic (Reservation request model).

**Context:** This is the primary interaction for a customer and the trigger for the entire reservation confirmation workflow.

#### **User Story 1.3: Admin Reservation Dashboard**
**As a** Restaurant Admin,
**I need to** see a visual layout of my tables and their status (Green: Available, Yellow: Pending, Red: Confirmed) for a selected day,
**so that** I can have a quick overview of the restaurant's occupancy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The admin dashboard has a date selector.
- On selecting a date, a visual grid of tables is displayed.
- The color of each table accurately reflects its status for the majority of the selected business day.
- Clicking a table shows details of the reservation(s) for that table.
- The admin can manually confirm or reject a "pending" reservation from this dashboard UI (as a fallback before Telegram is integrated).

**Tech Stack:** Next.js (UI for table grid, state management like Zustand/Valtio), FastAPI (endpoint to fetch all reservations and table statuses for a given date).

**Context:** This visual dashboard is the admin's command center. Its clarity and accuracy are paramount for managing the restaurant floor.

### **Phase 2: Real-time Admin Workflow & Telegram Integration**

This phase brings the application to life with automation and real-time feedback.

#### **User Story 2.1: Telegram Notification on New Reservation**
**As a** System,
**I need to** automatically send a message to a designated admin Telegram chat when a new reservation request is submitted,
**so that** the admin is immediately notified without having to watch the dashboard.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The backend listens for successful "pending" reservation creations.
- A background task is triggered to send a message via the Telegram Bot API.
- The message must contain: Client Name, Date, Time, Party Size, and Phone Number.
- The message must include two inline keyboard buttons: "✅ Confirm" and "❌ Discard".
- The system must handle potential failures in sending the message (e.g., Telegram API is down) and log the error.

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI (Background Tasks), `python-telegram-bot` or `httpx` (to call Telegram API), Pydantic (serializing data for the message), Secure storage for Bot Token and Chat ID (Environment Variables).

**Context:** This feature is a core requirement, moving the system from a passive tool to a proactive assistant for the admin.

#### **User Story 2.2: Handle Admin Actions from Telegram**
**As a** Restaurant Admin,
**I need to** be able to click the "Confirm" or "Discard" buttons in the Telegram message to update the reservation status,
**so that** I can manage reservations on the go directly from my phone.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The backend exposes a secure webhook endpoint for Telegram to call.
- When the "Confirm" button is pressed, the webhook receives the request, identifies the reservation, and updates its status to "confirmed".
- When the "Discard" button is pressed, the reservation status is changed to "discarded" or the record is deleted.
- The original Telegram message should be updated to reflect the action taken (e.g., buttons disappear, text changes to "Confirmed by [Admin Name]").
- The webhook must be secured to prevent unauthorized requests.

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI (webhook endpoint), `python-telegram-bot` (handling callback queries), Pydantic (validating incoming data from Telegram), Database logic to update reservation status.

**Context:** This completes the remote management loop, making the Telegram integration a powerful, two-way communication channel.

#### **User Story 2.3: Real-time Dashboard Updates**
**As a** Restaurant Admin,
**I need to** see the table on my dashboard change from yellow to red instantly after I confirm a reservation via Telegram,
**so that** the dashboard is always synchronized with reality without needing a page refresh.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The Next.js frontend establishes a WebSocket connection with the FastAPI backend upon loading the dashboard.
- After the backend updates a reservation's status (from the Telegram webhook), it broadcasts a message over the WebSocket.
- The message should contain the `table_id` and the new `status`.
- The frontend client listens for this message and updates the color of the corresponding table in the UI.
- The connection should be resilient and attempt to reconnect if dropped.

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI (WebSockets support), Next.js (client-side WebSocket handling, state management to update the UI), Redis Pub/Sub (for scaling WebSockets across multiple backend instances, optional for a single instance).

**Context:** This feature provides a modern, seamless user experience and ensures the admin always has the most current information.

### **Phase 3: Client Experience & Automation**

This phase focuses on reducing admin workload and improving the customer journey.

#### **User Story 3.1: Automated Client Reminders**
**As a** System,
**I need to** automatically send a reminder message (via Email or SMS) to the client 2 hours before their confirmed reservation,
**so that** we can reduce the rate of no-shows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A scheduled job runs periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes).
- The job queries the database for "confirmed" reservations occurring within the next 2 hours.
- For each matching reservation, it sends a formatted reminder to the client's email/phone.
- The reservation is marked as `reminder_sent` to prevent sending duplicate messages.
- The system handles clients who cancel *after* a reminder is scheduled but *before* it's sent.

**Tech Stack:** Celery & Redis/RabbitMQ (for robust, distributed background scheduling), `fastapi-mail` (for email), Twilio/Vonage API (for SMS), Cron job on the server.

**Context:** This is a high-value business feature. It directly impacts the restaurant's bottom line by minimizing lost revenue from empty, reserved tables.

### **Phase 4: Polish, Analytics & Deployment**

This final phase makes the application professional and ready for the real world.

#### **User Story 4.1: Admin Analytics Dashboard**
**As a** Restaurant Admin,
**I need to** view a simple analytics page with key metrics like daily/weekly reservations, peak hours, and no-show rates,
**so that** I can make data-driven decisions about staffing and promotions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A new `/analytics` page is available in the admin dashboard.
- It displays charts for reservations over time (line chart).
- It shows the most popular reservation times (bar chart).
- It calculates and displays the confirmation rate vs. discard rate.
- Data can be filtered by a date range.

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI (new endpoints for aggregating data), Next.js with a charting library (e.g., `Recharts`, `Chart.js`), SQL (for writing efficient aggregation queries).

**Context:** This transforms the tool from a simple operational manager into a business intelligence asset, providing insights for growth.
